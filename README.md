# **Dashboard Platform for Risk Insights**

## **Objective**
The goal of the **Dashboard Platform for Risk Insight** project is to consolidate data from multiple Trend Micro solutions — including **Cloud App Security, Trend Micro Email Security,** and **Worry-Free Business Security** — into a single dashboard for centralized visibility and security monitoring of the environment.


The application was built using **Python** to handle API data collection, data processing, and insertion into the database. **PostgreSQL** was used as the database, and the dashboard was maintained and visualized using **Grafana**.
